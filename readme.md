# Libft

 #### This is small guide for the functions of the libft.

The Libft is  a lib with the most common functios in the most basic libs in c.

I separte it in "String Functions", "Write Functions", "Memory Functions" and "Linked List Functions".

To comie the lobrary i made the make file so you only need to write "make" and to delete the *.o and the a.out write "make fclean".

The functions explain their self.
